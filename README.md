# Academic-cv
A LaTeX-based curriculum vitae. Not yet a template, as it essentially contains my own information. It requires the following packages installed:
* [LuaTeX](https://www.luatex.org/)
* [Biber](https://ctan.org/pkg/biber)
* [Academicons](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/academicons)
* [Fontawesome](https://ctan.org/pkg/fontawesome)
